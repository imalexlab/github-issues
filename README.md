## About the project

The project is based on [create-react-app with the typescript template](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/).

The structure of the app is:

### .storybook

Storybook configuration.
Place your addons in the `main.js` file.

### public

Public files used during the build. Icons, favicon and manifest should go here

### src

`index.css` is the main styling file for the application

`index.tsx` is the entry point of our React app

`react-app-env.d.ts` is a declaration used for typescript

`serviceWorker.ts` is where you can configure the service workers. This is the Create-React-App default configuration.

`setupTests.ts` is the file to setup the tests. We are using here [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library).

`storyshots.test.ts` initialize the snapshots of stories. More informations of the configuration [here](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/storyshots/storyshots-core).

#### components

Components of your app

Basic UI components should have this structure:

- A folder with the name of the component
- An `index.tsx` file entry point
- A `{ComponentName}.stories.tsx` file for the stories
- A `{ComponentName}.test.tsx` file for the test

#### constants

Places your constants here. If your constants are sensible (e.g. an API key), you should use the environment variables instead.

#### services

Place your function that connect to the API here.

Service is currently very specific. It could be more generic if needed.

## Improvments

Improvments could be:

- E2E Testing
- Implement the Issue Detail page with the comments
- Implement the User Detail page
- Implement filters and sorting
