If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\n\r\nThese `SchedulingProfiler` marks are currently being used by our experimental [concurrent mode profiler tool](https://react-scheduling-profiler.vercel.app).\r\n\r\nContext: Brian at https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/react/issues/5#issuecomment-656138017:\r\n\r\n> Since we are actively changing the \"lanes\" implementation and what the semantic value of a given lane is (e.g. facebook#19287) it would be helpful for us to encode some info in our profile that lets us match this information up later.\r\n>\r\n> I had been thinking about eventually encoding what the lanes ranges are, so we could display some meaningful label in the profiler, but maybe that would be a hassle and for now- we could get away with just marking the version of React the profiling data corresponds to. This would let us at least manually match the lanes up later if we wanted to dig in deeper.\r\n\r\nWe only add version strings to the render scheduled marks as these marks do not appear often and would thus provide the profiler with information it needs without unnecessarily bloating the profiles.\r\n\r\nThere is a known limitation to this approach: because renders are not scheduled often (generally only on page load), it is possible to generate profiles that do not contain React version numbers. Ideally, we'd want to log `ReactVersion` when we detect the start of a profiling session, but as far as we can tell this is currently not possible without integrating with Chrome DevTools.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/react/issues/35, and unblocks https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/scheduling-profiler-prototype/issues/73\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface. -->\r\n\r\n`yarn test`: tests for `SchedulingProfiler` have been updated. The new render scheduled marks look like this: `--schedule-render-1-17.0.0-alpha.0`.\r\n",

After this commit, React's behavior varies depending on which reconciler fork is being used.\r\n\r\n### Old reconciler fork\r\nReact will call `componentDidCatch` for the nearest unmounted error boundary (if there is one). If there are no unmounted error boundaries, React will still \"swallow\" the error because the return pointer has been disconnected so the normal error handling logic does not know how to traverse the tree to find the nearest still-mounted ancestor. (This behavior is not ideal, but it is temporary and will be replaced by the new fork.)\r\n\r\n### New reconciler fork\r\nReact will skip any unmounted boundaries and look for a still-mounted boundary. If one is found, it will call `getDerivedStateFromError` and/or `componentDidCatch` (depending on the type of boundary). Unmounted boundaries will be ignored, but as they have been unmounted– this seems appropriate.\r\n\r\nTests have been added for both reconciler variants. Note that **syncing this change to www/fbsource might appear as a regression**, because we may start logging errors that were previously ignored.\r\n\r\n### Open questions\r\n- [ ] Is the temporary fix in the old reconciler worth it? Should we just let it swallow errors for now until the new fork gets merged again?\r\n- [ ] Should we call gDSFE after an unmounted tree throws or should we only call cDC?\r\n- [ ] Is this bug (potentially) bad enough to warrant a v16 bugfix release?",

    "body": "React version: **^16.13.1**\r\n\r\nI had some code in my React app that handled loading Firebase and getting an AuthUser. Both the Firebase object and the AuthUser object were stored in their own contexts so they could be used throughout my app, and this worked fine. I then wanted to abstract this functionality into a component library so that I could reuse it easily between projects, and that's where this issue cropped up. I made my library using Neutrino,js since it was recommended on the React docs site, and the \"react-components\" preset for making component libraries creates a separate entrypoint for every file/directory in `src/components`. \r\n\r\nSo in my case, my build directory contained `Firebase.js` and `Session.js`, each of which exported their respective context, However, importing these contexts back into my original React app wouldn't work, as any changes to the value in the context provider (inside the library) would not propagate to the context consumers (outside the library/in my app). I confirmed this by checking the Component tree in dev tools (screenshots [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63267934/react-context-from-library-not-updating-in-consumer)).\r\n\r\nI eventually got around this issue by following [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60655639/3325942) from SO. Basically just make an index.js that imports/re-exports everything so that it's all considered one module. This made it work, but now my imports went from\r\n```\r\nimport AuthuserContext, {withAuthentication} from \"my-library/Session\";\r\nimport Firebase, {withFirebase} from \"my-library/Firebase\";\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\nimport {AuthuserContext, withAuthentication, Firebase, withFirebase} from \"my-library\";\r\n```\r\nwhich feels a lot messier. Is there a fix for this or is this expected behavior for Contexts? And if so, can that change in the future?\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Bootstrap a Neutrino.js react-components preset.\r\n2. Create a file that exports a context and updates the value asynchronously (in my case loads firebase, but you could probably even do a setTimeout).\r\n3. Create a file that uses that contexts provider.\r\n4. Create an HOC that wraps an element with contexts consumer.\r\n5. Build the Neutrino.js project and import the HOC into another project and wrap a component with it. Notice that the consumer won't ever update.\r\n\r\nThe buggy context code is available on [this commit](https://github.com/BUUPE/React-Components/tree/a34cfd58c00dface71031c3ba551cc778c1b8e83) of my component library.\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nContext can be used within the module/library it was defined in, but consumers won't update if they are defined outside the library.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nContext would update anywhere the consumer is,",

Sometimes the error won't occur. I'm also having trouble creating a minimal sample to reproduce this.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nThere is no error.\r\n\r\n## Investigation\r\n\r\nThe relevant line in the callstack where the error is occurring is here https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/03de849af03996b7477420c97de7741ce1214149/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMInput.js#L415\r\n\r\nI suspect it might be the same issue discussed here https://github.com/Availity/react-block-ui/issues/18\r\n>This was a real pain to track down, but apparently IE 11 will just throw Unspecified error. when accessing document.activeElement from an <iframe>, sometimes.\r\n\r\nThe solution they used to fix the error was to use this function instead of accessing document.activeElement directly https://gist.github.com/Alex1990/046a6553dc83e22dd6f4\r\n\r\nIdeally this function could be used inside React as well.

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test-prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\n\r\nTrying to solve #18051  and #18937 .\r\n`exhaustive-deps` eslint rule does not recognize a `JSXIdentifier` as needed dependency.\r\n\r\nThis is because eslint scope `.references` does not include JSX.\r\nI have pushed only a failing test with the aim to keep on working on it.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface. -->\r\nFailing test where an hook uses a `JSXIdentifier` that is properly added to deps array while the eslint rules marks it as unnecessary.\r\n",

Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nuseEffect logs: `cpcc*1 + ppcc*n + pppc*1`\r\nuseLayoutEffect logs: `cpcp*(1+n) + cppc*1`\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nboth useEffect and useLayoutEffect should log: `cppc*(1+n+1)`\r\n\r\n## Why I need a stable effect and cleanup order\r\nThere is a vanilla js package `mapbox-gl` whose use case is:\r\n```js\r\nimport mapboxgl from 'mapbox-gl';\r\nvar container = document.querySelector('#map');\r\nvar map = new mapboxgl.Map({ container });\r\n\r\nmap.on('load', function () {\r\n  // every thing should be done after load\r\n  map.addSource('route_source', route_source_data);\r\n  map.addLayer({\r\n    source: 'route_source',  // the layer relies on the source\r\n    id: 'route_layer',\r\n    ...other_layer_config,\r\n  });\r\n  // ...;\r\n  do_many_things();\r\n  // ...;\r\n  // you must remove the layer before removing the source\r\n  map.removeLayer('route_layer');\r\n  map.removeSource('route_source');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I want to make a react version:\r\n```jsx\r\nvar vdom = (\r\n  <Map opts={x}>\r\n    <Source opts={xx}>\r\n      <Layer opts={xxx}></Layer>\r\n    </Source>\r\n  </Map>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n \r\nBut since the order of react effect and cleanup in parent and child component is not stable (well, it' stable but it's weird), things became complex.\r\n\r\nI think the effect and cleanup order matters because there are dependency relations between parent and child components.\r\n\r\nAnd react should handle it.\r\n\r\nThere are some related(maybe) issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16728\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/17080\r\n\r\nAnd the react lifecycle order is works right: https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-lifecycle-effect-order-right?file=index.js",
